About this Notebook:
In this notebook, we learn how to use scikit-learn to implement simple linear regression. We download a dataset that is related to percentage score of students based on number of hours studied. Then, we split our data into training and test sets, create a model using training set, Evaluate our model using test set, and finally use model to predict unknown value.
